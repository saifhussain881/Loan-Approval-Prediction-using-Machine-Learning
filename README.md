# Loan-Approval-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

 What is a loan prediction system?

 A mechanism called the Loan Prediction System allows you to apply for loans and receive notifications when they are approved. By the data provided by the applicant, the system notifies the applicant of the loan's availability.

 The training dataset includes features such as Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area, and Loan_Status (Approved/Rejected). The goal is to create a Machine Learning model that can predict whether a loan application will be approved.

To gain insights and extract maximum information from the data, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted as the first step. Python libraries like Plotly (v4.9.0), Matplotlib (v3.3.0), and Seaborn (v0.10.0) were used for data visualization.

Several Machine Learning algorithms were experimented with, along with parameter tuning and the Voting Ensemble Method, to find the most effective classifier for the data. The aim was to assess the efficiency of these classifiers on the given dataset.
